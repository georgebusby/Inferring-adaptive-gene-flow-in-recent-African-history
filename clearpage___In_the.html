<div>In the Ju/hoansi, the top region of differentiation in the genome involves an increase in East Africa Niger-Congo ancestry at 26.1-26.6Mb on chromosome 10 (<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(-log_{10}P=17.14\)</span>, <span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\beta=2.07\)</span>) which contains <i>MYO3A</i>, a gene involved in hearing&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Walsh2002FromDFNB30}</cite>, and GAD2, which has been associated with decreased body mass index in Europeans&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Boesgaard2007ASubjects}</cite>. We also observe a significant increase (<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(-log_{10}P=11.48\)</span>, <span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\beta=1.86\)</span>) of East Africa Afroasiatic ancestry at 99.08-99.20Mb on chromosome 13, a region containing <i>FARP1</i> and <i>STK24</i>. <i>FARP1</i> is thought to be a member of the band 4.1 protein superfamily&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Koyano1997MolecularFactors}</cite>, a major structural component of red blood cell membranes&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Conboy1986MolecularSkeleton}</cite>. We also see an increase in West African Niger-Congo ancestry at 47.65-47.76Mb on chromosome 6 a region containing CD2AP, OPN5, GPR111, and GPR115 genes, and a large increase in Eurasian ancestry at DISP1 on chromosome 1 (<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(-log_{10}P=10.70\)</span>, <span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\beta=2.88\)</span>).</div><div>


Eight populations [Fig.&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{fig:figSharedAncestry}</span>] showed evidence of significant ancestry deviation at a short haplotype in the middle of the LDB2 gene on chromosome 4. All 8 of these populations come from East Africa and are either Nilo-Saharan or Afroasiatic speakers [Supplementary Table 1; Supplementary Fig.&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{fig:figLDB2}</span>]. We sought to characterise the nature of this signal further by combining data across all 235 individuals from these 8 populations (Sudanese, Somali, Anuak, Gumuz, Ari, Tigray, Amhara and Oromo) and the two other populations from the region with nominal evidence of deviation (Afar and Wolayta). In all cases, we observed a signal of increased Khoesan ancestry [Supplementary Fig.&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{fig:figLDB2}</span>a] and localised this to increased copying specifically from the Ju/hoansi, Xun, and Amaxhosa of southern Africa [Supplementary Fig.&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{fig:figLDB2}</span>d]. This differs considerably from a randomly selected SNP 1.5Mb downstream, with a more usual copying profile and where the Luhya and several Eurasian groups were typically copied more.
