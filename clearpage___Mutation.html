Our observation less Eurasian than expected at this locus suggests that African haplotypes have been beneficial at this locus after the admixture event that brought the Eurasian ancestry into the Fula; that is, within the last 2,000 years. Similar effects at this locus have been observed before: based on an analysis of allele frequencies, selection following admixture between Austronesians and sub-Saharan Bantus is likely to have driven frequencies of the Duffy null mutation to higher than expectations based on admixture proportions.</h2><div>Our observation of less Eurasian ancestry than expected at this locus suggests African been beneficial at this locus after admixture event that brought into Fula; that is, within the last 2,000 years.
