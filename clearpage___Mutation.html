Our observation less Eurasian than expected at this locus suggests that African haplotypes have been beneficial at this locus after the admixture event that brought the Eurasian ancestry into the Fula; that is, within the last 2,000 years. Similar effects at this locus have been observed before: based on an analysis of allele frequencies, selection following admixture between Austronesians and sub-Saharan Bantus is likely to have driven frequencies of the Duffy null mutation to higher than expectations based on admixture proportions&nbsp;</h2><h2>Malagasy of Madagascar&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Hodgson2014NaturalMadagascar}</cite>, and a recent study of Sahel populations showed an excess of African ancestry at this locus in Sudanese Arabs and Nubians&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Triska2015ExtensiveBelt}</cite>.</h2>
