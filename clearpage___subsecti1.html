<h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">Patterns of ancestry deviation across populations</h2><div>To explore ancestry deviations across the full dataset, we generated a table of the top 159 signals across all populations. These 159 signals were all above a conservative significance threshold of&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(-log_{10}P\geq 8\)</span> [Fig.&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{fig:figSharedAncestry}</span>; Supplementary Table 1], although we note again that identifying the correct threshold is difficult in this instance.</div><div></div>
