In addition to the Fula, we observe multiple ancestry deviations in another Gambian population the Jola [Fig. <span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{fig:figSharedAncestry}</span>; Supplementary Fig. <span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{fig:suppJolafig}</span>] . In the Jola, the most deviated region of the genome involves a significant increase in Eurasian ancestry at 27.3-28.2Mb on chromosome 6 which containing several HLA genes (<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(-log_{10}P=12.76\)</span>,<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\beta=1.94\)</span>), a signal that was also observed in the Wollof, also from the Gambia (<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(-log_{10}P=10.41\)</span>,<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\beta=1.57\)</span>). We also observed a significant increases of Eurasian ancestry at MYO3B (<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(-log_{10}P=13.53\)</span>, <span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\beta=1.97\)</span>) and SMOC2 (<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(-log_{10}P=9.40\)</span>, <span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\beta=1.75\)</span>), and an increase in Khoesan ancestry on chromosome 11 at NLRP10 (<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(-log_{10}P=12.87\)</span>, <span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\beta=2.24\)</span>), which codes for a protein involved in inflammation and apoptosis&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Inohara2003NODs:Apoptosis,Tschopp2003NALPs:Inflammation}</cite>.</div><div>


In just under two thirds (31) of the other 46 sub-Saharan African populations we observed no significant genome-wide deviations in ancestry using a conservative significance threshold of <span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(-log_{10}P\geq 8\)</span> [Fig. <span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{fig:figSharedAncestry}</span>; Supplementary Table 1], and observed multiple (<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(&gt;5\)</span>) significant signals in just 3 populations: the Jola and Fula from the Gambia, and the Ju/hoansi from Namibia. Around a quarter (39/159; 24.5%) of the loci identified across the 48 populations, of which 32 were in the Jola, Fula and Ju/hoansi, were discounted from further analysis because of potential reciprocal copying, resulting in a final list of 114 loci, 79% of which were in the Fula, Jola, and Ju/hoansi.</div><div>
