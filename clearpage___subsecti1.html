<h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">Patterns of ancestry deviation across populations</h2><div>To explore ancestry deviations across the full dataset, we generated a table of the top 159 signals across all populations. These 159 signals were all above a conservative significance threshold of&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(-log_{10}P\geq 8\)</span> [Fig.&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{fig:figSharedAncestry}</span>; Supplementary Table 1], although w</div><div>In just under two thirds (31) of the other 46 sub-Saharan African populations we observed no significant genome-wide deviations in ancestry. We observed multiple (<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(&gt;5\)</span>) significant signals in just 3 populations: the Jola and Fula from the Gambia, and the Ju/hoansi from Namibia. Around a quarter (39/159; 24.5%) of the loci identified across the 48 populations, of which 32 were in the Jola, Fula and Ju/hoansi, were discounted from further analysis because of potential reciprocal copying, resulting in a final list of 114 loci, 79% of which were in the Fula, Jola, and Ju/hoansi.</div>
