<div data-label="fig:admOverview">Overview of admixture events inferred in Sub-Saharan Africa. For reference, we show the main admixture events inferred previously by <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Busby2016AdmixtureAfrica}</cite>. For each of 48 African populations, we characterise the main admixture event inferred from chromosome painting using GLOBETROTTER&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Hellenthal2014AHistory}</cite> including the date(s) of admixture and the ancestry composition of the two admixture sources contributing to an admixture event. In 12 populations we infer two admixture events which happened at the same time if there is a single admixture date, or, in the case of two events, reflect the source composition of the earlier event. In all cases the sum of the minor and major admixture sources bars adds up to 1</div>
