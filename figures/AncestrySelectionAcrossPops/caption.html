<div data-label="fig:figSharedAncestry"><b>Genome-wide ancestry deviations across sub-Saharan Africa. </b>For each of the 114 loci (rows) where we observe ancestry deviations with a <span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(-log_{10}P\geq 8\)</span>, for each population (columns) we show the ancestry that has changed (colour) and the direction of change (lighter colours show decrease, darker increase) and the strength of significance (black box <span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(-log_{10}P\geq 8\)</span>; no box <span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(8\leq-log_{10}P\geq 4\)</span>; grey = <span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(-log_{10}P&lt;4\)</span>. The positions of the significant loci are shown on the right and genes of interest, together with the detailed genomic region, are shown on the left.</div>
