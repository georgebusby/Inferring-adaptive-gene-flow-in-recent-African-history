<div data-label="fig:figVarCovar">\label{fig:figVarCovar}Negative covariance of ancestry deviations in the Fula. <b>a</b> top right diagonal shows of heatmap shows covariance at genome-wide SNPs; bottom left are SNPs that are significant in either of the ancestry region pair; the diagonal shows the variance and mean in brackets within each ancestry region <b>b</b> the genome-wide distribution of <span class="ltx_Math math v1">\(\beta\)</span> coefficients, split by ancestry, across all SNPs and normalised to have a maximum density of 1. <b>c</b> the distribution of <span class="ltx_Math math v1">\(\beta\)</span> coefficients for significant SNPs, normalised to have a maximum density of 1. in panels <b>b</b> and <b>c</b> lines are coloured by ancestry as in panel <b>a</b>
