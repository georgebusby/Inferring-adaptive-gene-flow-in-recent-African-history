<div data-label="fig:suppfulalct">Comparison of Fula and One Thousand Genome Project (1 haplotypes at the&nbsp;<i>LCT/MCM6</i> region. rs4988235 is one of the two main SNPs present in the lactase persistence haplotype. The SNP is not present in our dataset. To ascertain whether the signal we identified in this region with our method is indeed due to the presence of the derived allelle at this SNP, we show the phased haplotypes of all 1KGP Eurasian individuals who are homozygous for the derived variant at rs4988235 as well as the haplotypes for those Fula who copy Eurasia donors across the LCT region, and those that do not. The same haplotype is shared across the known 1KGP lactase persistence allele carriers and the Fula individuals who copy Eurasia, suggesting that the signal is indeed related to the presence of the lactase persistence haplotype in the Fula.</div>
