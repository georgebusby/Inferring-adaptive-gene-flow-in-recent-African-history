<div data-label="fig:figLDB2"><b>Increased Khoesan ancestry at LDB2</b>. <b>a</b> local ancestry across 4700 painted chromosomes from East African Nilo-Saharan and Afroasiatic speakers at the 14-19Mb region of chromosome 4. <b>b</b> results of the binomial ancestry deviation test shows a significant increase in Khoesan (green) ancestry between 16.2 and 16.8Mb. <b>c</b> UCSC genes across this region. <b>d</b> comparison of donor copying at two SNPs on chromosome 4, rs43003974 is 1.5Mb upstream of the main signal and most copying at this SNP comes from the Luhya; conversely at kgp656116 most copying comes from three Southern African groups: The Ju/hoansi, Xun, and Amaxhosa.</div>
