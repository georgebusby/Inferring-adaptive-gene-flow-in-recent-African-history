<div data-label="fig:fig2">Local ancestry deviations in the West African Fula. Each main panel is made up of 5 sub-panels
showing, from top to bottom: the recombination rate across the region; ancestry proportions coloured by region as in Figure 1; evidence for deviation based on the binomial deviation model; <span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(P\)</span> values for the likelihood ratio test, coloured by ancestry; the associated <span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\beta\)</span> coefficient fit by the LRT for each ancestry; the genes in the region. <b>a</b> lack of Eurasian ancestry around <i>DARC</i> on chromosome 1; <b>b</b> excess Eurasian ancestry around the <i>LCT</i> and <i>MCM6</i> genes on chromosome 2; <b>c</b> increased Central West African ancestry at the GYP genes on chromosome 4. <b>d</b> increased Khoesan copying at the SERPIN genes on chromosome 18</div>
