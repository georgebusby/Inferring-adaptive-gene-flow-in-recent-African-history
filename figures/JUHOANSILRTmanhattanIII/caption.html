<div data-label="fig:suppJuhoanfig">\label{fig:suppJuhoanfig}Manhattan plot showing ancestry deviations in the Ju/hoansi. The left panel shows <span class="ltx_Math math v1">\(-log_{10}\)</span> P values based on the binomial likelihood test for each of the 7 non-self ancestries tested in the Fula. SNPs with P values greater than 8 are highlighted with the colour of the ancestry that the deviation is seen. The central panel shows the change (<span class="ltx_Math math v1">\(\Delta\)</span>) in ancestry observed at significant SNPs.The right panel gives information about the top ’hit’ SNP and the genes within the genomic region around the hit.</div>
