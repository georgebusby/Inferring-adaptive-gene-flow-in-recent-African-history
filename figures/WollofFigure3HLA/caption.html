<div data-label="fig:fig3">\label{fig:fig3}Investigating local ancestry at the HLA in the Wollof. <b>a</b> local ancestry across 2160 Wollof haplotypes at the 30-35Mb region of chromosome 6. <b>b</b> results of the binomial ancestry deviation test shows a significant increase in Nilo-Saharan (purple) ancestry between 32.2 and 33Mb. <b>c</b> ancestry proportions from a local painting analysis in a single Anuak individual showing Western African (dark blue) ancestry. <b>d</b> UCSC genes across this region. <b>e</b> genome-wide distribution of unique Nilo-Saharan donors in the Wollof. <b>f</b> the proportion of unique donors when each of 7 non-self ancestries are copied across the 30-35Mb region of chromosome 6. <b>g</b> the number of times the most common haplotype is copied; the colour under the line represents the ancestry of the most copied individual.</div>
