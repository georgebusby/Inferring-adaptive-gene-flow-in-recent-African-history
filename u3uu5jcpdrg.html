<div></div><div>Mutations in an intron in <i>MCM6</i> , a regulatory element for <i>LCT</i> lead to the lactose persistence phenotype&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Ingram2008LactosePersistence}</cite> (the ability to digest milk into adulthood), and represent one of the clearest signals of recent natural selection in the genome. Lactose persistence has evolved at least twice independently&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Bersaglieri2004GeneticGene}</cite>, in Europe and in East Africa&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Ranciaro2014GeneticAfrica}</cite>. Encouragingly, our analysis identifies this Eurasian haplotype, despite the SNP set not containing the ‘European’ lactase variant (13910 C<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(&gt;\)</span>T polymorphism, rs4988235; Supplementary Fig. <span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{fig:suppfulalct}</span>) and suggests that the European haplotype has entered the Fula as a result of gene-flow from Europe approximately 2kya. In both this case and that of <i>DARC</i> described above, our ancestry based analysis provides new insight into the potential origins of selected mutations.</div>
