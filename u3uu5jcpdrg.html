<div>Our observation of less Eurasian ancestry than expected at this locus suggests African been beneficial at this locus after admixture event that brought into Fula; that is, within the last 2,000 years. Similar effects at this locus have been observed before: based an analysis allele frequencies, selection following admixture between Austronesians sub-Saharan Bantus is likely to have driven frequencies of the Duffy null mutation to higher than expectations based admixture proportions in Malagasy Madagascar&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Hodgson2014NaturalMadagascar}</cite>study Sahel populations showed excess African this locus Sudanese Arabs Nubians&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Triska2015ExtensiveBelt}</cite>.</div><h2 data-label="564153" class="ltx_title_subsection"></h2><div>Mutations in an intron in <i>MCM6</i> , a regulatory element for <i>LCT</i> lead to the lactose persistence phenotype&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Ingram2008LactosePersistence}</cite> (the ability to digest milk into adulthood), and represent one of the clearest signals of recent natural selection in the genome.

Encouragingly, our analysis identifies this Eurasian haplotype, despite the SNP set not containing the ‘European’ lactase variant (13910 C<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(&gt;\)</span>T polymorphism, rs4988235; Supplementary Fig. <span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{fig:suppfulalct}</span>) and suggests that the European haplotype has entered the Fula as a result of gene-flow from Europe approximately 2kya. In both this case and that of <i>DARC</i> described above, our ancestry based analysis provides new insight into the potential origins of selected mutations.</div>
